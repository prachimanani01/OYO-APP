## `Introduction`
Welcome to the OYO App! This project is a study-purpose implementation of a hotel and room booking application, inspired by the OYO app, and built using the Flutter framework. The app includes a homepage, detail page, drawer, and booking page. 

The primary aim of this project is to demonstrate UI design and basic navigation in Flutter. By replicating the features of a well-known hotel booking app, this project serves as an educational tool for understanding the development process, including the design, structure, and navigation of a mobile application. This app does not connect to a backend service or process actual bookings; it is strictly for learning and demonstration purposes.

The **Homepage** provides a list of available hotels, allowing users to browse through various options. Each hotel entry includes an image, name, location, and price, offering a quick overview for potential customers.

The **Detail Page** offers more in-depth information about a selected hotel, including additional images, descriptions, amenities, and reviews. This page aims to give users a comprehensive understanding of what the hotel offers before making a booking decision.

The **Drawer** enhances the app's navigation by providing a sidebar menu that users can access from any page. This drawer typically contains links to the homepage, booking page, settings, and other relevant sections of the app, making it easier for users to navigate.

The **Booking Page** simulates the booking process, where users can select a room type, choose check-in and check-out dates, and provide their details to finalize a booking. While this page mimics the steps of an actual booking, it is designed for UI practice and does not process real transactions.

This project not only showcases the capabilities of the Flutter framework in creating beautiful and responsive UIs but also serves as a foundation for those looking to build their own booking applications. Whether you are a student, developer, or hobbyist, exploring this project will enhance your understanding of mobile app development using Flutter.
